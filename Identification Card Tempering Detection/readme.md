# Flask Image Difference Detection

This Flask Python project aims to detect differences in images, specifically identification cards. The application provides a user-friendly interface to compare and identify discrepancies between two images.

## Use

Follow these steps to run the application:

**Step 1:** Clone the project repository to create a local copy.

**Step 2:** Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where the `app.py` file is located.

**Step 3:** Create a virtual environment using the following command:

```shell
conda create -n <environment_name>
```

Replace `<environment_name>` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

**Step 4:** Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```shell
conda activate <environment_name>
```

Again, replace `<environment_name>` with the name you provided in the previous step.

**Step 5:** Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that all the necessary packages are installed in your virtual environment.

**Step 6:** Start the application by running the following command:

```shell
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server. Once the server is running, copy the provided URL and paste it into your web browser.

**Step 7:** The `sample_data` folder contains images that can be used for testing the application. Feel free to use these images or replace them with your own to observe the image difference detection.

Enjoy using the Flask Image Difference Detection application!
